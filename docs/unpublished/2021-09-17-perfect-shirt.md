I am a minimalist. 

Not because I want to be. Because I need to. As a child, my room was always a complete mess. I absolutely hated cleaning it. 

As part of my Engineering program, I moved a lot. And by a lot, I mean 3-4 times per year. Throughout the process, I discovered what I truely valued, and what I could easily live without. This made moving way easier. It also made my life a lot better in many ways. Cleaning up became faster. I stopped buying unnecessary junk. I stopped wasting time. 

Throughout my journy, I found there was a name for this: minimalism. And going down the rabbit hole, I discovered a number of new techniques. One of which was to wear a uniform. The benefits claimed include: 
- Always wearing my favorite shirt/pants
- No mornings deciding what to wear 
- No temptations to buy new clothes
- Always looking great (or at least consistent)
 
 Yes. This is something I want and could achieve. So I did what any rational person would do. Find a nice grey shirt that seemed nice. Buy 8 of them. Ditch all my other shirts. Continue on with the rest of my life. I had done it. I won. That was easy.

The shirt was perfectly comfortable in the winter when I bought it. But as summer began, I knew I had made a huge mistake. The super soft cotton proved to be heavy. And hot. I'd leave the house and be instantly drenched in sweat. The shirt also started stretching in some ways, shrinking in others. My once perfect set of shirts become uncomfortable and looked bad. Maybe I should have done some research...

## Aspects of a T-shirt

### Material Type
Material is the first and most obvious oversight. The type of fabric makes a huge difference in how the shirt feels. Cotton is your typical t-shirt material. Looks like a shirt. Feels like a shirt. But, it tends to shrink in the dryer. And as soon as it gets wet, it holds onto moisture leaving me drenched on a hot day. Polyester solves these shortcomings, but has its own. It's commonly used for sports appearal, as it handles moisture extremely well. However, it looks and feels like I'm wearing a gym shirt. And wearing a gym shirt all day is definetly not fashionable, despite what 10 year old me would have said. Also, keep polyester away from the fire. I learned that the hard way. 

### Material Weight 
Another important, but often overlooked consideration is the material weight. In the US, it's measured as oz/yd^2 (thanks imperial), though most often referred to simply as oz. As one would expect, lighter shirts (3-4oz) are cooler while heavier shirts (6+ oz) tend to be warmer. They also look different. Heavier shirts tend to hold their shape, while lighter shirts tend to drape closer to the body.

### Cut
There are three main features of cut: size, fit, and length. All three factors vary from place to place but generally: 
- Size: Usually refers to what the shirt size is around the chest and shoulders. 
- Fit: Usually refers to the size around the waist. Generally the fits are regular, athletic and slim.
- Length: Rarely listed, it's how long the shirt is. This one is very much a guess and check.
