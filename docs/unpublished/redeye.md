# Optimizing a red eye

My goal for every overnight flight (redeye) is to sleep on the flight and wake up rested enough to have a good day at my destination. I consider myself successful ~80% of the time. No, I do not fly business, though wish I could.

This is not easy. There's a lot outside of my control. I try to bring as much into my control as possible. I do this by:

- Booking the right flights at the right time
- Buying a window seat
- Bringing an eye mask, ear plugs, water, food, and melatonin
- Telling the person beside to not wake you up for food
- Hoping for the best

Inspite of everything, it's impossible to guarantee sleep. There's always the chance of a screeming baby.
Hopefully with these tips will help you make the most of your next redeye.

# Booking the right flight

To pick a flight, I use the following set of criteria in priority order:

- Daytime or nighttime flight
- Nonstop flights > layovers
- Longer flights > shorter flights
- Departs ~30min before bedtime
- Weekdays > weekends
- Window seat

The first and most important question: Do I need to take a redeye at all? Will a daytime flight better serve me.

Assuming yes, my first goal is to try to get a direct flight. Direct flights are better since I can try sleeping for one continuous block instead of wake up, navigate a foreign terminal, then try to sleep again. I keep reminding myself that "yes, it's worth paying more to do so".

If a direct flight is not possible, I try to get a single long leg. If I'm flying from San Francisco to Ottawa, it's far better to fly SFO -> YUL -> YOW compared to SFO -> CHI -> YOW, even though the total travel time is longer. Each leg through Chicago is 3-4hrs, which after taxi, takeoff, and landing, there's very little to sleep. San Francisco to Monteral is long enough to be able to actually sleep.

Timing is super important not just for both sleep and jet lag, but can be difficult to get right. I start from my ideal bedtime. Lets say 11:00pm. My ideal departure time is about 30 min before bedtime. This gives enough time to taxi, takeoff and not screw up my sleep schedule.

Unfortunately this becomes more complicated with timezones. For example flying SFO -> YUL -> YOW, is it better to depart at 10:30pm PST or 7:30PST (10:30pm EST)? The later flight will be better for sleep quality, while earlier flight will be better for jet lag. On shorter flights (~5-6hr), I'll take the better sleep. On longer flights (9+hrs), I'd prefer the destination timezone.

Weekdays are slightly preferable to weekends. In my experince, weekday red eyes tend to have more business travellers, while weekends tend to have more families. By families, I mean screaming babies. There's no guarantees that weekdays will be scream free, but I do what I can to give me as much luck as possible.

BUY THE WINDOW SEAT. Yes it's a scam that that airlines force customers to pay for seats. However, paying for a window seat is one of the best ways to reduce the number of disturbances inflight. I've regretted not getting the windows seat enough times that it's a must.

# Preparing for the flight

General rules I follow when preparing for a red eye:

- Reduce caffeine, avoid eating a large airport meal
- Pack a personal item
- Bring ear plugs and an eye mask
- Bring your own food and water
- Bathroom
- Melatonin when boarding

Reducing caffeine intake helps me sleep better.
