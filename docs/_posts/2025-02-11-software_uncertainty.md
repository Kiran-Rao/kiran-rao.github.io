It's often said that software estimation is impossible.
I disagree.
It's very possible to estimate and ship a project on a specific date.
You do so by shipping whatever complete, even if the project is not finished.
This gives rise to the _Software estimation uncertainty principle:_

> As scope becomes exact and fixed, completion time becomes uncertain.

> As completion time becomes exact and fixed, scope becomes uncertain.

<!-- > In software engineering, if the scope exact and fixed, it's impossible to know the completion time.  -->
<!-- > Likewise, if the completion time is exact and fixed, it's impossible to know the scope.  -->

So when a manager says they need to know exactly when it'll be done, respond with "What scope/features can make optional to ensure we hit our estimated date"
