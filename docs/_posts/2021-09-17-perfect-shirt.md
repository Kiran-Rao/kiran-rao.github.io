In school, I moved a lot. And by a lot, I mean 3-4 times per year. Throughout the process, I discovered what I valued, and what I could live without. As I whittled away my stuff, I noticed my life improving. Cleaning became faster. I stopped buying junk. I stopped wasting time.

I found there was a name for this: minimalism. A bunch of these "minimalists" . The benefits claimed include:

- Always wearing my favorite shirt/pants
- No mornings deciding what to wear
- No temptations to buy new clothes
- Always looking great (or at least consistent)

Hell yeah! So I did what any reasonable person would do. Picked the first grey shirt that I liked. Looked good. Felt good. Bought 8 of them. Ditch all my other shirts[1]. Done. That was easy.

The shirt was perfect in the winter. But as summer began, I realized my mistake. The super soft cotton proved hot and heavy. I'd leave the house and be instantly drenched in sweat. Over time, the shirt started stretching and shrinking in weird ways. My once perfect shirts become uncomfortable and unflattering. Maybe I should have done some research...

# Aspects of a T-shirt

## Material Type

Material is the first and most obvious oversight. The fabric makes a huge difference in how the shirt feels. Cotton is your typical t-shirt material. Looks like a shirt. Feels like a shirt. But, it tends to shrink in the dryer. Once it gets wet, it holds onto moisture. Polyester solves these shortcomings, but has its own. It's commonly used for sports appearal because it handles moisture well. However, it looks and feels like a gym shirt. Unfortunately, gym shirts are not fashionable, despite what 10 year old me thought.

## Material Weight

Another often overlooked consideration is the material weight. In the US, it's measured as oz/yd^2 (thanks imperial), though most often referred to simply as oz. As one would expect, lighter shirts (3-4oz) are cooler while heavier shirts (6+ oz) tend to be warmer. They also look different. Heavier shirts tend to hold their shape, while lighter shirts tend to drape closer to the body.

## Cut

There are three main features of cut: size, fit, and length. All three factors vary from place to place but generally:

- Size: S/M/L/XL etc. Usually refers to what the shirt size is around the chest and shoulders.
- Fit: Regular/Athletic/Slim etc. Usually refers to the size around the waist.
- Length: Rarely listed, it's how long the shirt is. This one is a guess and check.

[1] I did not actually "Ditch all my other shirts". I instead donated the bulk of my aging shirt collection to Salvation Army. I kept a few that I really liked for special occations.
